## 💡 Project Description  
Infinite Loopers is an interactive web laboratory of absolutely unnecessary technology — designed to entertain, confuse, and waste time productively.

### Features include:  
- 👋 **Gesture Control** – Wave at your laptop, it waves back (might even open MS Paint).  
- 🎤 **Scream-to-Type** – Yell at your computer to make it type nonsense.  
- 🔢 **Useless Math** – Solve math problems that have zero practical value.  
- 💗 **Self-Love AI** – Compliments you until you’re dangerously overconfident.

## 🤔 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)  
In a world drowning in productivity tools — to-do lists, habit trackers, SMART goals — people are forgetting the joy of wasting time.  

We say: **STOP.** It’s time to embrace creative procrastination.  

---

## 🚀 The Solution (Nobody Asked For)  
We created a Useless Project Lab that:  
- Tracks hand gestures to open Paint or spam Rickrolls.  
- Converts your scream into chaotic, random typing.  
- Generates mathematical nonsense that helps in no exam.  
- Compliments you until you achieve peak overconfidence.

## 📦 Large Executable File Notice  
Due to GitHub’s 100 MB file size limit, we couldn’t upload our `.exe` file directly to this repository.

📤 Distribution Plan & Hosting Limitations
Offline Mode: Windows .exe — no Python required.
Developer Mode: pip install infinite-loopers (planned).

However, the compiled .exe is ~450 MB, which:
Exceeds GitHub’s 100 MB per-file limit, preventing us from hosting it directly on the repository.
