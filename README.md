# 🎯 Infinite Loopers  
**A Celebration of Pointless Genius**

## 💡 Project Description
An **interactive web laboratory** of absolutely unnecessary technology, featuring:

- 👋 **Gesture Control** – Wave at your laptop, it waves back (and might open MS Paint).  
- 🎤 **Scream-to-Type** – Yell at your computer to type nonsense for you.  
- 🔢 **Useless Math** – Math so pointless it won’t help you in exams.  
- 💗 **Self-Love AI** – Compliments you until you’re dangerously overconfident.  

The goal?  
**Entertain, confuse, and waste time productively.**

## 🤔 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People are drowning in **productivity tools** — to-do lists, habit trackers, SMART goals.  
We say: **STOP.** You deserve to waste time creatively.  

---

## 🚀 The Solution (nobody asked for)
We built a **Useless Project Lab** that:
- Tracks your hand gestures… to open Paint or spam Rickrolls.  
- Converts your scream into chaotic typing.  
- Generates math problems that achieve nothing.  
- Compliments you until you’re unreasonably confident.
