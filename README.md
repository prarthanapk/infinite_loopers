💡 Project Description
Infinite Loopers is an interactive web laboratory of absolutely unnecessary technology, designed to entertain, confuse, and waste time productively.

It features:

👋 Gesture Control – Wave at your laptop, it waves back (might even open MS Paint).

🎤 Scream-to-Type – Yell at your computer to make it type nonsense.

🔢 Useless Math – Solve math problems that have zero practical value.

💗 Self-Love AI – Compliments you until you’re dangerously overconfident.

🤔 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
In a world drowning in productivity tools — to-do lists, habit trackers, SMART goals — people are forgetting the joy of wasting time.

We say: STOP. It’s time to embrace creative procrastination.

🚀 The Solution (nobody asked for)
We created a Useless Project Lab that:

Tracks hand gestures to open Paint or spam Rickrolls.

Converts your scream into chaotic, random typing.

Generates mathematical nonsense that helps in no exam.

Compliments you until you achieve peak overconfidence.
